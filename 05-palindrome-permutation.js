5. Any permutation a palindrome
Write an algorithm to check whether any anagram of some string is a palindrome. Given some string, "acecarr", the algorithm should return true, because 

the letters in "acecarr" can be rearranged to the anagram "racecar", which itself is a palindrome. In contrast, given the word "north", the algorithm 

should return false, because there's no anagram for "north" that would be a palindrome.
